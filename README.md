<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

 <img src="images/newsletter.png" alt="Logo" width="1000" height="450">

While adding the newsletter content we are checking for <b>latestTime</b> key in the redis. If the new content time is less than the already stored <b>latestTime</b> key in redis then update all the keys in the redis, which are

1. latestTime
2. latestText
3. latestTopic
4. latestId - ID of the content document

The scheduler script runs on an interval of 1 minute and checks whether the current time is equal or greater than the latestTime stored in the redis.

If the above condition satisfies then the mail is sent to all the subscribers of the **latestTopic**.
After sending the mail the sent content is deleted and the next latest deadline content is stored in the redis database
